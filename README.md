Due: Sept. 28 2018

Please read the instructions in the attached document carefully before starting to write code.


Five (5) important points to be followed for all assignments

Submit just the source (*.java) files in one ZIP file here. Do not include old java (*.java~) or class files in the zip.
All your files must have a header with your name, class, and assignment information.
Remove package statement from the top of all files, if your IDE adds it.
Make sure that you add proper comments for appropriate lines of code as well as all methods.
Any questions, ask me only, since this is an assignment.

Professor's Comments and Grade:

You must pay attention to compiler warnings, to write reliable and ﻿﻿secure code.﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿ 
The type of item for ArrayList must be indicated when it is being initialized, even if your IDE doesn't catch that.


Class comments are comments about each class. Why did you think that I would give 10 points for you copy and paste my instructions (the same ones) on every class?

The doesExist method is not tested, probably because it won't work,as the equals method is not implemented in Fish. 

What was the purpose of adding those characters to the beginning of every line in the output? They made the output less readable.

The tester is not testing all the methods, as evident from the output.

The transfer method is called twice. Calling a method twice unnecessarily can have negative consequences.
